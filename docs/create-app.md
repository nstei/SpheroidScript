# Create an app

Before you create an app, [authorize](ide-authorize.md) in the Spheroid Demiurge IDE.

Open the "Apps" tab and click the "Create" button.

Enter the app name, leave the check on the "Create a layer corresponding to this app" box and click the "Create App" button. The app will be created along with the layer you will later use to publish the app into.

If the app doesn't get immediately created, and you get the error "Can't create an app because the app with the name 'xxx' already exists", it means the name you've chosen is already taken, so try another one.
