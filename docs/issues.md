## Provide an app id

To help us to solve your issue in the most efficient way, we kindly ask you to 
provide us with your app id.

You can find the app id on the app page. Open the "Apps" tab and open the app details page 
by clicking on the preview. You will see the app id next to the owner name.

## Share access to your app to the support team

You can also share access to your app to the Spheroid Universe support team. 
This way you will allow our team to access you app files and repeat your actions 
to reproduce the problem. This is an optional step but it may be the best and fastest way 
to find a solution to your issue. 

Open the "Apps" tab and then open the app details by clicking on the preview. 
Click the "Add" button below the list of team members in the "Team" tab. If you don't see 
the "Add" button, it means you're not an owner of this app and therefore can't add a new member.

"support@spheroiduniverse.io", click "Add" and then "Save".
